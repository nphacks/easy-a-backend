Ancient Egypt was one of the world's earliest civilizations, flourishing along the Nile River for thousands of years. The Nile provided water, fertile land, and transportation, making agriculture and trade possible. Every year, the river flooded, depositing rich silt that allowed farmers to grow crops like wheat and barley. The Egyptians developed irrigation systems to manage the water and support a growing population. This stable food supply helped their civilization thrive.

Egyptian society was highly organized, with a pharaoh at the top, considered both a king and a god. Below the pharaoh were government officials, priests, scribes, and artisans. Farmers and laborers made up the majority of the population. The Egyptians built massive pyramids as tombs for their rulers, believing in an afterlife where the pharaohs would need their possessions. The Great Pyramid of Giza remains one of the most famous structures from this period.

Religion played a central role in Egyptian life. They worshiped many gods, including Ra (the sun god), Osiris (god of the afterlife), and Isis (goddess of protection). Priests performed rituals and maintained temples to keep the gods happy. Egyptians also believed in mummification, preserving bodies for the afterlife. This process involved removing internal organs, drying the body with natron, and wrapping it in linen before placing it in a decorated tomb.

Egyptians made significant contributions to writing, mathematics, and medicine. They developed hieroglyphics, a system of picture writing, which scribes recorded on papyrus scrolls. They created a calendar based on the stars and made medical advancements, including setting broken bones and performing surgeries. The civilization lasted for over 3,000 years before being conquered by the Persians, Greeks, and later the Romans, but its legacy remains in art, architecture, and culture.
