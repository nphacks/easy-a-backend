The American Revolution was a conflict between the thirteen American colonies and Great Britain. The colonies, frustrated by British taxes and lack of representation in Parliament, sought independence. Key events leading up to the war included the Stamp Act, the Boston Tea Party, and the Intolerable Acts. Colonists began organizing resistance, forming militias, and spreading revolutionary ideas through pamphlets like Thomas Paine’s Common Sense.

The war began in 1775 with the Battles of Lexington and Concord. George Washington was appointed as the commander of the Continental Army. Early battles were challenging for the Americans, as they lacked proper military training and resources. However, victories such as the Battle of Saratoga in 1777 boosted morale and convinced France to provide military support. The war became a turning point in world history as it inspired other independence movements.

The final years of the war saw major battles like the Siege of Yorktown in 1781, where British General Cornwallis surrendered to American and French forces. This effectively ended the fighting, leading to the Treaty of Paris in 1783. The treaty officially recognized the United States as an independent nation and set its borders. The revolution also led to the drafting of the U.S. Constitution, shaping the country’s government and principles.

The American Revolution had lasting effects on the world. It introduced the idea that people had the right to overthrow unjust rulers and inspired revolutions in France and Latin America. The war also brought changes within American society, promoting democratic ideals and challenging traditional hierarchies. However, issues like slavery and women’s rights remained unresolved, leaving challenges for future generations.
